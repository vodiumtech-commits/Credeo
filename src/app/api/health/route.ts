/**
 * GET /api/health — machine-readable status for an uptime monitor.
 *
 * Built because breakage was reaching vendors before we knew about it. Point
 * any uptime service (UptimeRobot, BetterStack, Vercel monitors) at this and
 * alert on a non-200; it answers "is the platform actually working?" rather
 * than merely "does the site return HTML?".
 *
 * Deliberately leaks nothing: no counts, names, or amounts — only whether each
 * dependency is reachable and whether the reminder pipeline looks alive.
 * Returns 200 when healthy, 503 when something needs attention.
