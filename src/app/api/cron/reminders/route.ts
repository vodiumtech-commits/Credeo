/**
 * GET /api/cron/reminders
 *
 * Runs every 5 minutes (see vercel.json). It must be frequent: a 30-minute
 * credit has a 10-minute reminder window, so a daily schedule would miss short
 * credits entirely — the window opens and closes between runs and the credit
 * then falls out of the pre-due query as soon as it is overdue.
 *
 * Per-day work (score decay) lives in /api/cron/daily so it is not repeated
 * 288 times a day.
 *
 * SCHEDULING IS EXTERNAL. This project does not use Vercel cron; the schedule
 * lives in cron-job.org, which must call:
 *
 *     GET https://www.vodiumledger.com/api/cron/reminders
 *     Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>
 *
 * every 5 minutes. That interval is not arbitrary — it must stay at or below
 * the shortest reminder window the bot can produce (10 minutes, for a "30M"
 * credit), or short-dated credits are never reminded at all.
 *
 * Because the schedule is not in this repo, changing the lead times here has a
 * consequence nothing in the codebase can enforce: update the external job too.
 * Finds every credit within its reminder window that hasn't been reminded yet,
 * sends a WhatsApp message to the student, and stamps reminderSentAt.
 *
 * Protected by CRON_SECRET (Vercel injects this automatically).
