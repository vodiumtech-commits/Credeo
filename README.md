# Vodium Ledger

> Africa's credit infrastructure layer — starting with Nigerian university campuses.

A WhatsApp-first credit tracking and intelligence platform that helps campus vendors safely extend credit to students, automate repayment reminders, and access cross-vendor credit scores.

This is **Phase 1 of Vodium** — the data and revenue foundation that earns us the right to launch Vodium Premium (a consumer credit card brand) in Year 2.

---

## Vision

```
Phase 1 (Now)   → Campus credit infrastructure (B2B SaaS for vendors)
Phase 2 (Yr 2)  → Consumer credit products for graduates entering the workforce
Phase 3 (Yr 3+) → Vodium Premium card for affluent professionals & HNWIs
```

Every paying vendor and every tracked repayment builds the proprietary credit graph that no Nigerian fintech currently owns.

---

## The Problem

Nigerian campus vendors extend millions of naira in informal credit daily — food, provisions, printing, laundry — and have no system to track it. Defaults go unrecorded. There is no shared credit history. A student who defaults at one canteen walks straight into the next one.

Vodium Ledger gives vendors a 15-second way to log a credit, reminds students automatically, and builds a cross-vendor score that de-risks every future transaction.

## What We've Built

### Authentication
- Phone OTP login via Twilio Verify with Nigerian phone number normalisation
- Email OTP via Resend as a 2FA layer for account creation and login
- Session management with rate-limited OTP requests (3 attempts / 10 minutes)
- Dev fallback: OTP printed to terminal when Twilio is not configured
- Vendor registration flow with business details, campus, and vendor type

### WhatsApp Bot (full state machine)
- Vendor onboarding entirely via WhatsApp: name → business → university → account created
- Add a credit: `ADD` → student name → amount → due date → confirmed and logged
- Mark as paid: `PAID <student name>` — closes the credit and triggers score recalculation
- View all owing students: `LIST` — returns formatted list of outstanding balances
- Credit score lookup: `SCORE <student name/matric>` — returns Vodium Score + summary
- Built-in reminders: `DASHBOARD`, `SUPPORT`, `HELP` menu
- Persistent session state stored in PostgreSQL (`WhatsAppSession` model)
- Pure state-machine logic in [`src/lib/whatsapp/state-machine.ts`](src/lib/whatsapp/state-machine.ts) — no I/O, fully testable

### Web Dashboard (vendor-facing)
- Phone OTP protected login at `/login`
- Main dashboard at `/dashboard` with:
  - Total owed, paid this month, customers owing, recovery rate (KPI cards)
  - 6-month credit volume chart (extended vs recovered)
  - Overdue credits table with days-overdue indicator
  - Due-soon credits (within 48 hours)
  - Live activity feed (8 most recent events)
- Credit management at `/dashboard/credits` — full credit list with filters
- Customer list at `/dashboard/customers`
- Add credit via web at `/dashboard/credit/new`
- Settings page at `/dashboard/settings`

### Automated Reminders (cron job)
- Daily Vercel Cron job at `/api/cron/reminders`
- Finds every outstanding credit due within 48 hours that hasn't been reminded
- Sends WhatsApp message to student with amount and vendor name
- Stamps `reminderSentAt` to prevent duplicate sends
- Respects pending (unregistered) student phone numbers — skips them cleanly

### Credit Score Engine (rule-based v1)
- Vodium Score: 0–1000 scale, 500 baseline for new students
- Score events: `PAID_ON_TIME` (+25), `PAID_LATE` (−15), `DEFAULTED` (−80), `WRITTEN_OFF` (−120)
- Recency weighting — recent events matter more than older ones
- Volume bonus — being trusted repeatedly by multiple vendors is a positive signal
- Human-readable summary tiers: Excellent / Good / Building / Risky / High risk
- Cross-vendor: one student's score reflects behaviour at all participating vendors

### Subscription Billing
- Three-tier pricing: Starter (₦2K/mo), Growth (₦5K/mo), Campus Pro (₦10K/mo)
- Paystack webhook handler for `subscription.create`, `charge.success`, `subscription.disable`, `invoice.payment_failed`
- Trial → Active → Past Due → Cancelled lifecycle fully handled
- Trial period support with `trialEndsAt` field

### Data Model
- `University`, `Vendor`, `Student`, `Credit`, `Repayment`, `CreditScoreEvent`
- `WhatsAppSession` for bot conversation state
- `AuditLog` for every credit and repayment action
- `VendorSubscription` for billing state
- Full index coverage for performance at scale

### Admin Panel
- Internal admin dashboard at `/admin` (separate auth)
- Vendor management at `/admin/vendors`
- Analytics at `/admin/analytics`

### Infrastructure
- Sentry error monitoring on server, edge, and client
- Upstash Redis for OTP storage and rate limiting
- Vercel cron configured in `vercel.json`
- Seed script for dev data at `scripts/seed.ts`

## Security & Compliance

### Authentication & Sessions
- **HMAC-SHA256 signed session tokens** — raw phone number is never stored in a cookie; every session cookie is signed with `SESSION_SECRET`. Forging a session requires the server secret.
- **Time-scoped admin tokens** — admin sessions use `base36(iat).HMAC(secret,"v1:admin:"+iat)` with an 8-hour TTL. Rotating `SESSION_SECRET` immediately invalidates all admin sessions.
- **httpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookies only** — no auth state in localStorage or sessionStorage.
- **Constant-time comparison** — all HMAC/token comparisons use `crypto.timingSafeEqual` to prevent timing-oracle attacks.
- **Email OTP as 2FA** — both login and registration require a 6-digit code sent to the vendor's email (Resend). Single-use, 10-minute TTL, deleted immediately after verification.
- **Rate limiting on all OTP endpoints** — 5 attempts / 15 minutes for login, 3 OTP sends / 10 minutes for registration, 5 OTP verifications / 10 minutes.

### Webhook Security
- **Fail-closed webhooks** — if `SENDPULSE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` or `PAYSTACK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is not set in production, the webhook endpoint returns 503 and rejects all traffic. There is no silent fallback to an empty secret.
- **Paystack webhook** verifies `x-paystack-signature` using HMAC-SHA512 with `timingSafeEqual`.
- **WhatsApp webhook** verifies `x-secret-token` using a constant-time XOR loop.

### Middleware & Headers
- **Edge middleware** enforces session validity before `/dashboard/*` and `/admin/*` — invalid or forged cookies are cleared and the request redirected to `/login`.
- **Security headers on every response**: `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()`, plus a full `Content-Security-Policy`.

### Data & Access Control
- **Vendor data isolation** — vendor A cannot see vendor B's customers; every DB query scopes by `vendorId`. Student profile pages 404 if the authenticated vendor has no relationship with that student.
- **Vodium Score clamped** — score is always kept within [0, 1000]; WhatsApp bot uses `Math.min(1000, Math.max(0, …))` on every update.
- **NPS dismiss state in httpOnly cookie** — no localStorage; the 30-day cooldown can't be cleared by client-side scripts or XSS.
- **Input validation with Zod** — all API routes validate with strict schemas; `vendorType` is validated via `z.enum` (not cast), preventing invalid enum injection.

### Infrastructure
- No passwords — email OTP only; bcrypt hash stored only for WhatsApp-onboarded vendors.
- Minimal student PII: name, matric number, phone. No NIN/BVN in v1.
- NDPR-compliant privacy policy and consent flow (to be published with landing page).
- AuditLog on every credit and repayment action.
- Encryption at rest (Supabase default) + TLS in transit.
- Upstash Redis rate limiting on all sensitive endpoints (fails open when not configured — acceptable in development).
